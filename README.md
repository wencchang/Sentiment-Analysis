# Sentiment-Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis. Firstly, data preprocessing involves converting ratings into sentiment labels, splitting text, and removing stop words. Then, models using CNN and LSTM are built, with Dropout layers added for comparison, and training progress is visualized with accuracy and loss plots. Lastly, model evaluation is performed using test data from Kaggle to measure accuracy.
